This project is based on the #100DaysOfGatsby and will develop during the next 100 days.
As you can imaging by the Challenge name, this project is and will be build with Gatsby.
Additionally, I will use it as a playground to to play around with Gatsby and its amazing and fast growing system.

## To get started

Simply run `yarn develop` or, if you have installed gatsby globally `gatsby develop` to run a development server locally and start developing.

## To serve your site

Simply run `yarn build` or, if you have installed gatsby globally `gatsby build` to build your site with all the configurations for production usage.
It generates files in the public folder, which can be deployed wherever you want to host your website.
